# 06_weather_dashboard

## Description

This is my weather dashboard that uses the openweather API, along with materialize as my CSS framework.

## challenges

for this assignment I struggled more with managing my time with my project then the assignment itself however I feel as though I need to be looking at an example for everything I do which I need to work on. For this assignment I decided to use examples little to none, which made it much harder for me.
